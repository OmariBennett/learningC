# Learning C

I've posted this here before and it's what has worked for me an a few others who told me it worked for them as well. Ymmv.

People sometimes struggle with C when they start from scratch or come from a higher to lower level of abstraction. I struggled with this for a long time till I did these things:

I would not try and understand how the higher level abstractions translate to the lower C level. I would instead learn from first principles on how a computer works and build the abstractions up from there. You will learn how a CPU works. How the data bus and registers are used. How memory is laid out and accessed. The call stack and how that works, etc.. This will go a long way in understanding how C sits on top of this and how it's data structures like arrays and structs map to this and understanding how pointers work the way they do and why. **_Check out these resources:_**

1. Read [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA&ab_channel=SebastianLague)

2. Watch [Exploring How Computers Work](https://charlespetzold.com/code/)

3. Watch all 41 videos of [A Crash Course in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)

4. Take the [build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

5. Take the [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course.

6. Grab a copy of [C programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html) and use it as your main course on C.

7. Follow this [Tutorial On Pointers And Arrays In C](https://github.com/jflaherty/ptrtut13)

The first four really help by approaching C from a lower level of abstraction (actually the absolute lowest level and gradually adding layers of abstraction until you are at the C level which, by then is incredibly high!) You can do all four or pick one or two and dive deep. The 5th is a great introduction to computer science with a decent amount of C programming. The sixth is just the best tutorial on C. By far. The seventh is a deep dive into pointers and one of best tutorial on pointers and arrays out there (caveat, it's a little loose with the l-value/r-value definition for simplicity sake I believe.)
